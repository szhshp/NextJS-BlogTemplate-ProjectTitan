## Where the story begins

Github: [Project Titan](https://github.com/szhshp/NextJS-BlogTemplate-ProjectTitan)

- I'm [szhshp](https://szhshp.org/). My first blog is created with Jekyll, it is named `Project Gaia` and released in [Github](https://github.com/szhshp/JekyllTheme-ProjectGaia)
- In July 2020 I created a similar template `Project Titan` with NextJS
- The design of `Project Titan` is originated from `Project Gaia`
- `Project Titan` is for more experienced developer/blogger. 
- I tried to make it easy but it still require basic knowledge of **Typescript** and **NextJS**

## What's the differences? 

### Project Gaia

  + **EASY TO USE**
  + For beginner and light blogger
  + Based on **Jekyll** + **jQuery** + **Bootstrap**.
  + Traditional Stacks (HTML + CSS + JS)
  + Easy to setup/config via [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (or alternative services)
  + Do not require build process

### Project Titan

- Based on Typescript + [NextJS](http://nextjs.org/) + [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Modern Stacks
- Require build process (You can use CICD through Jenkins, Github Actions or Vercel)
